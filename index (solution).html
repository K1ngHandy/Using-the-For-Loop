    PROBLEM 1: You're building an application for teaching kids to count by printing out numbers from 1-10. Using a for loop, print to the console "1 Mississippi" to "10 Mississipi"
    */
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      console.log(`${i} Mississippi`);

   PROBLEM 2: Using a for loop, log all the commands in the variable "commands" to the console.
   */

    for (let i = 0; i < commands.length; i++) {
      console.log(commands[ i ]);
    }

    PROBLEM 3: Using a for loop, print all 'even' numbers in 'arr'
    */

      if (arr[ i ] % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(arr[ i ]);
      }

    PROBLEM 4: Using a for loop, delete all occurences of 15 in arr. Log arr to the console
    */
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[ i ] === 15) {
        arr.splice(i, 1);
      }
    }

    /* 
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The code below is meant to loop over and sum up all the numbers in the nums array. Your task is to log 'sum' to the console. Fix the code so the right value (10) is printed.
